I am pursuing my Ph.D. at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html){:target="_blank"} in college station, Texas, USA. I am working under the supervision of [Dr. Nitesh Saxena](https://nsaxena.engr.tamu.edu) at [SPIES Lab](https://spies.engr.tamu.edu). â€‹I began my Ph.D. studies at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in the fall of 2019 and transferred to Texas A&M University in the fall of 2021. My research focuses on the security of authentication systems, including state-of-the-art multi-factor and passwordless authentication systems. Additionally, my recent work includes investigating speech privacy and side-channel attack using smart devices and wearables sensors.

I have already published 10 of my papers at top-tier security and systems conferences and journals such as <ins>**ACM CCS**</ins>(3 papers), <ins>**ACM MobiCom**</ins>, <ins>**IEEE ICDCS**</ins>, <ins>**ACM Transactios on Privacy and Security**</ins>, <ins>**ACM Wisec**</ins>. Our works have already got significant [media attention](https://tanvirmahdad.github.io/media/) within security communities worldwide. I also have 6 (six) other works currently under review. I am expected to be graduated in Summer 2025.
