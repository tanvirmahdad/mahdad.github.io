My research interests lie in the area of security analysis of authentication systems, and their underlying protocols, side channel attacks using motion sensors of wearables and smart devices. In particular, I am working on designing novel attack approach that can reveal vulnerability in state-of-the art commercial and academic authentication systems. I have also worked on detecting non-semantic properties of voice using built-in motions sensors of wearables and smart devices.
